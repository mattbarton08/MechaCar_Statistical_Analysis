# MechaCar Statistical Analysis


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The two variables that were found to be statistically signifcant compared to miles per gallon were vehicle length and ground clearance.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Because the P-value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than 0.05%, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-Squared value is 0.7149, which shows us that it does a fairly good job of predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
